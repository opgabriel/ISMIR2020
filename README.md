> Detecting Collaboration Profiles in Success-based Music Genre Networks

## Abstract

We analyze and identify collaboration profiles in success-based music genre networks. Such networks are built upon data recently collected from both global and regional Spotify weekly charts.  Overall, our findings reveal an increase in the number of distinct successful genres from high-potential markets, pointing out that local repertoire is more important than ever on building the global music ecosystem. We also detect collaboration patterns mapped into four different profiles: _Solid_, _Regular_, _Bridge_ and _Emerging_, wherein the two first depict higher average success. These findings indicate  great opportunities for the music industry by revealing the driving power of inter-genre collaborations within regional and global markets.

## Goals and Contributions

We believe factors leading to an ideal musical partnership can be understood by exploring collaboration patterns that directly impact its success. Hence, we aim to unveil the dynamics of cross-genre connections and collaboration profiles in success-based networks (i.e., connections formed by genres of artists who cooperate and create hit songs). We do so through the following research questions (RQ).

* __RQ1__ _Does the regional aspect impact on popular genres and their hit songs?_

* __RQ2__ _How has genre collaboration evolved over the past few years?_

* __RQ3__ _Which are the potentially intrinsic factors and indicators that influence the collaboration success?_

In order to answer such questions, we first model genre collaboration in the music scenario as success-based networks. Then, we build a novel dataset with data from global and regional markets and present the network science concepts and metrics required for understanding the paper. Overall, our analyses and experiments over the networks reveal that:

1. Individually analyzing regional markets is fundamental, as local genres play a key role on determining hit songs and popular artists. 
2. In general, genre collaborations are increasing, with emerging local genres hitting global success -- despite the differences in the evolution of regional markets.
3. Genre collaborations analyses describe three significant factors (_Attractiveness_, _Affinity_ and _Influence_), to uncover four profiles (_Solid_, _Regular_, _Bridge_ and _Emerging_).
